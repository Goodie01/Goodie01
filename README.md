### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have some funky personal projects I'm working on

- Odin - a simple persistence library designed to be used on projects where you may wish to mock out a persistence layer before fully building one
- Melinoe - A testing framework for use with Selenium, Rest, and Hecate, designed to support all of these methods first class, while providing clearly readable logs.
- Hecate - A tool to quickly and easily intercept http requests, providing methods to modify them, and read what happened in review

Pronouns: He/Him
